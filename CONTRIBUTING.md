Bug reports, feature requests or code contributions are always very welcome.
To make things easier, here are a few tips:

Reporting bugs, requesting features
-----------------------------------

*   Best way to report bugs and request new features is to use GitHub
    [issues](https://github.com/PolygonTek/BlueshiftEngine/issues), but you can contact me
    also any other way.

Code contribution
-----------------

*   Follow the project coding guidelines. In short -- try to match style of the
    surrounding code and avoid any trailing whitespace.

*   Best way to contribute is by using GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/PolygonTek/BlueshiftEngine/pulls)
    -- fork the repository and make pull request from feature branch. You can
    also send patches via e-mail or contact me any other way.

*   All your code will be released under license of the project (see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)
    file for details), so make sure you have no problems with it. If you create new files, don't forget to add
    license header (verbatim copied from other files)
